 ## Workflow

[![**Figure 1:** Overview of workflow for `RQdeltaCT` package](RQdeltaCT_workflow.png)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQdeltaCT/vignettes/my-vignette.html#:~:text=The%20presented%20RQdeltaCT%20package%20includes,basic%20programming%20skills%20are%20required)

## 0. Installing Package

You can view the technical details about this package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQdeltaCT/index.html) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Donadelnal/RQdeltaCT). Then follow the steps below to install and load the `RQdeltaCT` package. Follow the steps below to install from the CRAN repository.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| warning: true

install.packages("RQdeltaCT")

```

Since you should already have already installed the `devtools` package for this class, you can also install `RQdeltaCT` directly from GitHub instead.

```{r}
#| eval: false

remotes::install_github("Donadelnal/RQdeltaCT")
```

Once you have installed `RQdeltaCT`, you can click [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQdeltaCT/RQdeltaCT.pdf) to learn more about what functions are included in this package.

## 1. Importing & Tidying Data

This package includes built-in `read_Ct_long()` and `read_Ct_wide()` functions for importing data, but these only recognize .csv and .txt files. However, most qPCR machines export results as an Excel spreadsheet (.xls, .xlsx). Below is a way to directly import specific sheets from Excel without having to create a separate file.

```{r}
#| eval: false

# The 'readxl' package allows you to open individual sheets from Excel without having to convert it into .csv or .txt format first

install.packages("readxl")
```
