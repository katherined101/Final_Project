My name is Katherine, and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.\n\n\nI am a member of the Singh Lab in the Department of Oncology Science, and my current research project focuses on how tumor cells reprogram stromal cell metabolism in pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n\nPrior to starting my PhD program, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Chemistry from Oral Roberts University, where I investigated the cytotoxic effects of 6-gingerol on colorectal cancer. I was also a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at UT Southwestern and was involved in validating a novel CRISPR-generated humanized PNPLA3 mouse model for studying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease."
