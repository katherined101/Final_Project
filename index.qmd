# Bio
Hi! My name is Katherine, and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.

## Research Goals
I am a member of the Singh Lab in the Department of Oncology Science, and my current research project focuses on how tumor cells reprogram stromal cell metabolism in pancreatic cancer.

## Experience
Prior to starting my PhD program, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Chemistry from Oral Roberts University, where I investigated the cytotoxic effects of 6-gingerol on colorectal cancer. I was also a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow at UT Southwestern and was involved in validating a novel CRISPR-generated humanized PNPLA3 mouse model for studying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
