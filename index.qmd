# Bio
Hi! My name is Katherine, and welcome to my journey of learning to code in R. 

## Research Goals
I am a 2nd year graduate student, and my current project focuses on how tumor cells reprogram stromal cell metabolism in pancreatic cancer.  

## Experience
Prior to starting my PhD program, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Chemistry from Oral Roberts University and completed a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at the UT Southwestern.
